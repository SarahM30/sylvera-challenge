# Sarah Muirhead - Sylvera Tech Challenge 

## Brief 

The aim is to create a NextJS powered webpage which fetches and displays a list of projects and allows you to click on a project to view a list of device IDs, latitude, longitude, and the time of that feed entry.

## Getting started

### System requirements 
- Node.js 14.6.0 or newer
- MacOS, Windows (including WSL), and Linux are supported

### Running project 

Firstly clone the repository and then run the following commands in your terminal. 

```bash
yarn                                            # to install dependencies
yarn dev                                        # to get the dev version up and running
```
